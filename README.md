# Vufind For Emu

### Introduction
These instructions are for how the University of Liverpool set up Vufind to work with Axiell's EMu. 
They will cover the customisations that we made to Vufind (the adding of XSLTs, the SOLR schema.xml  etc.) and how we exported our information from EMu. The field names we use in these files might or might not relate to what you want to use and it is up to you to make sure that these work for your institution.
